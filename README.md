# py-bgo: A Python implementation of Bayesian global optimization

The module is called **pybgo**.

Documentation soon to come.
For some examples, see:

* [Cluster optimization example](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/cluster-opt-bgo)
* [Inverse problem example](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/inverse-bgo)

In order to use the GlobalOptimizer class you need to install the pymc
branch of our own version of GPy. You can do this by:

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/GPy.git@pymc
```
